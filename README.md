I have used VsCode Platform to do this task "FILE HANDLING UTILITY".This Java program demonstrates basic file operations, including writing to a file, reading from a file, and modifying a file. The program uses Java's built-in file I/O APIs to perform these operations.The program consists of four main methods:
- writeToFile: Writes text to a file using a BufferedWriter.
- readFromFile: Reads text from a file using a BufferedReader.
- modifyFile: Modifies text in a file by replacing a given string with a new string.
- main: Demonstrates how to use these methods to perform file operations.
- The readFromFile method takes a file name as input and reads the text from the file using a BufferedReader. This method is useful for reading existing files.
- The modifyFile method takes a file name, an old string, and a new string as input. It reads the text from the file, replaces the old string with the new string, and writes the modified text back to the file.
- The main method demonstrates how to use these methods to perform file operations. It creates a new file named "example.txt", writes the text "Hello, World!" to it, reads the text from the file, modifies the text by replacing "World" with "Universe", and reads the modified text from the file.
